HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
All you need to do is downlaod the Jar file and double click on it to run the application.
Another way to do it is to donwload and install an IDE that can start up JavaFx Applications such as IntelliJ or eclipse. Once that is done, downlaod the repository. After that, simply click run and you will have the application.

PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
This is my first JavaFx application that I built using Java which was for one of my assignments in my second year of computer science. I received 74% for this project. Both the code and the report has been added to this repository.

The goal of this application is to test my knowledge on Java and learn how JavaFx is different to writing simple java applications. I did this by creating an educational game for young children that will teach them about Maths.

Feel free to have a look around and contact me, leave comments or issue requests with things I could have done better - I'm all about learning how to write better code.
